## Problem Title
SIH 1653: Web based Selector-Applicant Simulation Software
## Problem Description
Background: Recruitment and Assessment Centre (RAC) under DRDO, Ministry of Defence carries out interviews for applications received against advertised vacancies and for promotion to next higher grade for scientific manpower inducted within DRDO. Description: The process of interviewing is a challenging task. An unbiased objective interviewing process helps identify the right talent. The basic process of an interview involves posing a set of questions by an interviewer and thereafter evaluating responses from candidates. Thus, the questions asked should be relevant and match the area/ expertise of the applicant and the responses should also be of relevance w.r.t. the question asked. Expected Solution: The proposed solution should provide experts as well as candidates a real life Board Room experience, starting with initial ice-breaking questions leading to in-depth techno-managerial (depending on the level of candidate) questions. It shall also be able to provide a quantifiable score for experts as well as the candidate for the relevancy of questions w.r.t. the area/ expertise of the applicant. Similarly, candidate responses should also be graded for relevancy w.r.t. the question asked, finally assisting in arriving at an overall score for the subject knowledge of the candidate and thus his/ her suitability against the advertised post.

## Idea

## **1. Expected Solution**  
A **real-life boardroom simulation system** that:  
- Facilitates **structured and adaptive interviews**.  
- Ensures **domain-relevant questioning**.  
- **Quantifies** the relevance of questions and responses.  
- **Generates an overall score** for candidate suitability.  

## **2. AI-Based Interview Simulation**  
- **Structured questioning**: Starts with **ice-breaking** questions, progressing to **technical and managerial** ones.  
- **Adaptive questioning**: AI **modifies question difficulty** based on candidate responses.  

## **3. Expert-Validated Question Bank**  
- Questions generated from **AI-powered knowledge base** curated by **DRDO experts**.  
- Dynamic selection of **domain-specific questions** based on applicant’s expertise.  

## **4. Automated Candidate Response Analysis**  
- AI evaluates responses based on:  
  - **Relevance to the question**  
  - **Depth of technical knowledge**  
  - **Clarity and accuracy**  

## **5. Bias-Free & Standardized Scoring**  
- AI-driven assessment **removes human biases** and ensures fair evaluation.  
- **Scoring metrics**:  
  - **Question Relevance Score** – how well questions match the candidate’s expertise.  
  - **Response Relevance Score** – how well the candidate’s answer aligns with the question.  
  - **Overall Suitability Score** – final assessment of the candidate.  

## **6. Advanced Analytics & Reporting**  
- **Performance reports** for interviewers and candidates.  
- **Data-driven insights** to improve future interview processes.  

## **7. Secure & Scalable Integration**  
- **Complies with MoD cybersecurity policies**.  
- **Facial recognition & speech analysis** for identity verification.  

## **8. Key Benefits to DRDO & MoD**  
   **Objective & Transparent** – AI ensures fair, bias-free evaluations.  
   **Efficient & Scalable** – Speeds up recruitment and promotion processes.  
   **Data-Driven Decision Making** – Generates structured reports for hiring panels.  
   **Security & Compliance** – Ensures confidentiality and prevents fraud.
